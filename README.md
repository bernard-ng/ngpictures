# Ngpictures 3.0.0

*Begin developing PSR-15 middleware applications in seconds!*

[zend-expressive](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive) builds on
[zend-stratigility](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-stratigility) to

The user selected packages are saved into `composer.json` so that everyone else
working on the project have the same packages installed. Configuration files and
templates are prepared for first use. The installer command is removed from
`composer.json` after setup succeeded, and all installer related files are
removed.

## Getting Started
You can then browse to http://localhost:8080.

> ### Linux users
>
> On PHP versions prior to 7.1.14 and 7.2.2, this command might not work as
> expected due to a bug in PHP that only affects linux environments. In such
> scenarios, you will need to start the [built-in web
> server](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) yourself,
> using the following command:
>
> ```bash
> $ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public/ public/index.php
> ```

> ### Setting a timeout
>
> Composer commands time out after 300 seconds (5 minutes). On Linux-based
> systems, the `php -S` command that `composer serve` spawns continues running
> as a background process, but on other systems halts when the timeout occurs.
>
> As such, we recommend running the `serve` script using a timeout. This can
> be done by using `composer run` to execute the `serve` script, with a
> `--timeout` option. When set to `0`, as in the previous example, no timeout
> will be used, and it will run until you cancel the process (usually via
> `Ctrl-C`). Alternately, you can specify a finite timeout; as an example,
> the following will extend the timeout to a full day:
>
> ```bash
> $ composer run --timeout=86400 serve
> ```

## Application Development Mode Tool

This skeleton comes with [zf-development-mode](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-development-mode). 
It provides a composer script to allow you to enable and disable development mode.

### To enable development mode

**Note:** Do NOT run development mode on your production server!

```bash
$ composer development-enable
```

**Note:** Enabling development mode will also clear your configuration cache, to 
allow safely updating dependencies and ensuring any new configuration is picked 
up by your application.

### To disable development mode

```bash
$ composer development-disable
```

### Development mode status

```bash
$ composer development-status
```

## Configuration caching

By default, the skeleton will create a configuration cache in
`data/config-cache.php`. When in development mode, the configuration cache is
disabled, and switching in and out of development mode will remove the
configuration cache.

You may need to clear the configuration cache in production when deploying if
you deploy to the same directory. You may do so using the following:

```bash
$ composer clear-config-cache
```

You may also change the location of the configuration cache itself by editing
the `config/config.php` file and changing the `config_cache_path` entry of the
local `$cacheConfig` variable.
